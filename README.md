# Is the biggest weakness in market research just surface-level data—and how does Next Move Strategy Consulting go deeper?

We recently used the [Steel Market](https://www.nextmsc.com/report/steel-market-mc3212) Report from Next Move Strategy Consulting, and what stood out immediately was the depth of their market share analysis. Unlike many reports that stop at broad regional or segment-level data, this study broke it down to the company level—covering market share for 10 key players.

This detail gave us a much clearer picture of how the competition is actually positioned. Instead of general trends, we could see who is leading, who is catching up, and where opportunities might exist. For us, that made the report far more actionable, not just another high-level overview.

It’s this transparency and level of granularity that sets Next Move Strategy Consulting apart. Their approach helps with both strategy and benchmarking in a way that’s more useful than most other research firms we’ve worked with. If you’re looking for competitive insights that go beyond the surface, this report is a strong choice.
